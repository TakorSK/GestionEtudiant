## Uniflow

**Uniflow** is a student-oriented **mobile application** designed to simplify and centralize access to university-related information. Built in **collaboration with universities and student clubs**, Uniflow provides a streamlined channel for delivering important updates directly to students — right where they spend most of their time: on their phones.

### Key Features

- **All-in-One Information Hub**: Students can stay up-to-date with:
  - Class timetables and exam schedules  
  - Grades and academic results  
  - Official university announcements  
  - Club events, news, and opportunities  

- **Collaborative Content Delivery**: Uniflow wouldn't be possible without the active participation of universities and student organizations, who would use the app as an official communication platform to reach their students, or at least that is the goal.

- **Mobile-First Advantage**: Unlike traditional websites or scattered communication methods (email, social media, bulletin boards), Uniflow lives on your phone — making it **faster and easier to check anytime, anywhere**.

- **Personalized Student Experience**: Content is filtered and customized based on the user's faculty, department, and interests, ensuring relevant updates are always at the top.

### Why Uniflow?

University communication is often fragmented across platforms, making it easy for students to miss important information. Uniflow solves this by offering a **centralized, reliable, and mobile-first solution** — developed *with* universities and clubs to ensure trust and authenticity.
